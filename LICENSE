1. COPYRIGHT OWNERSHIP
The "Crowd OS" system architecture, specifically the "SecureEvent" logic linking Stationary Thermal Omni-Nodes to Mesh-Networked Wristbands, is the exclusive intellectual property of:
Prasurjya Deka.

2. COMMERCIAL RESTRICTIONS (STRICTLY PROHIBITED)
*   NO COMMERCIAL USE: You may NOT use, copy, modify, distribute, or sub-license this architecture, software, or logic flow for any commercial product, military application, or crowd management service without express written permission from Prasurjya Deka.
*   NO DERIVATIVE WORKS: You may NOT create "remixes" or modified versions of the "SecureEvent" algorithm chain (Bicubic Interpolation -> Watershed -> Mesh Trigger) to sell as your own product.

3. LEGAL DISTINCTION FROM PRIOR ART (US PATENT 12392583B2)
This work is legally and technically distinct from the "Body safety device with visual sensing" described in US Patent 12392583B2 (Assignee: GovernmentGPT Inc.).
*   Crowd OS utilizes STATIONARY INFRASTRUCTURE sensors (clamped to poles/walls) to detect crowd fluid dynamics.
*   Crowd OS does NOT utilize body-worn visual sensors, cameras, or sensors integrated into tactical gear/vests.
*   Any attempt to conflate this infrastructure-based system with body-worn tactical patents is rejected as factually incorrect.

4. THIRD-PARTY ATTRIBUTION (PHYSIOKIT)
Portions of the wearable hardware design are adapted from the open-source "PhysioKit" architecture.
